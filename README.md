## Case Study (PLEASE READ BEFORE WORKSHOP #3)

Louis Vuitton (LV) will host an exhibition "SERIES 88" in Beijing on January 8, 2019. This VVIP event will feature [Nicolas Ghesqui√®re](https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/nicolas-ghesquiere) (art director) and other high profile fashionistas. The lucky guests will enjoy a night of champagne üçæ and glamour.

The LV team have decided to invite a few of their top spending chinese customers. 1 month before the event they want to send each VVIP an **interactive flyer** through WeChat inviting them to **SIGN UP**. When the VVIP guests arrive at the event, security need to be able to easily validate each guest and **CHECK THEM IN**. 

Thanks to its creative track record and *strong technical capabilities*, **DLG works with LV on a retainer basis**, but LV works with multiple agencies and it's not guaranteed you will win this project. You have been asked to propose the best tech solution for this event registration process. LV wants to combine a beautiful flyer for easy SIGN UP through WeChat and a smooth process for security CHECK IN.

It's time for you to prepare your proposal for a meeting where you will try to convince the LV China team and other stakeholders to trust your solution.

During the initial project briefing, you could see the LV team was unsure of the best direction. Should this registration solution be *designed and built totally from scratch*? or is there a suitable *existing software as a service* they could take advantage of? or perhaps a *hybrid solution (existing API back-end + custom front-end?)*. To answer this question you need to do your research and be ready to justify your recommendation. LV is a huge luxury brand and they are inviting their most important customers, the process must be smooth and nothing can go wrong.

### Assessment

Your business unit will be scored on your ability to clearly define:
- Project specifications (10 points): SMART goals and prototype
- Solution recommendation (10 points): how + why
- Project planning & workflow (10 points)

### Deliverable
- 10 minutes presentation, 3 minutes Q&A

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **No need to start working on this case** before Saturday October 27, as the afternoon is allocated for this group work.
